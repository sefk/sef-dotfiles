# Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.
# The default is ``no''. Note that this option applies to protocol
# version 2 only.

GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
### Forward (delegate) credentials to the server. The default is
# ``no''. Note that this option applies to protocol version 2
# only.

GSSAPITrustDns yes
# Set to ``yes'' to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely canonicalize the name of the
# host being connected to. If ``no'', the hostname entered on the command line will be passed
# untouched to the GSSAPI library.  The default is ``no''.  This option only applies to protocol
# version 2 connections using GSSAPI.
